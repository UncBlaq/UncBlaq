Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm @uncBlack, a Backend Software Engineer specializing in building scalable APIs using Python (FastAPI) and Node.js (Express). I have experience working with databases like Supabase, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and use Redis for caching and performance optimization.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Tuition, a payment platform that integrates with Flutterwaveâ€™s API to streamline educational payments.

Backend: [Tuition API Docs](https://tuition2-crra.onrender.com/docs#/) (under development and pushing actively and aggresively)
Frontend: https://altwavetuition.vercel.app/ (under development)
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m expanding into frontend development with JavaScript frameworks and plan to dive into Blockchain and AI in DeFi, focusing on Solidity and Rust.

ðŸ’» Iâ€™ve applied Test-Driven Development (TDD) to projects like Tuition and a Movie API app, where I also utilized Docker for containerization. Currently, Iâ€™m learning Kubernetes to enhance my deployment skills.

ðŸŽ¯ In addition to backend development, I work as a Web Designer at SabreWorks, making key technical decisions, deploying websites, and leveraging cloud services.
